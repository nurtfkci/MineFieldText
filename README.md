#MineField
##Text-Based MineField Game

The Minefield Game is a text-based Java game where players navigate through a grid to uncover safe coordinates while avoiding mines. <br>
The game allows players to choose the dimensions of the grid and provides feedback on the number of mines surrounding each cell. 
If a cell has no adjacent mines, it shows *-2*. <br>
The game ensures robust boundary checks, allowing players to re-guess if they select an out-of-bound coordinate. 
Victory is achieved when all non-mine coordinates are successfully uncovered.
